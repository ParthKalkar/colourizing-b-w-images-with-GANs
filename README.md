# colourizing-b-w-images-with-GANs
Image Colorization is an interesting gan project to work on. We all have some old photographs and reels which were shot in the times when colored filmography was a talk of the future. Wouldnâ€™t it be amazing if you can colorize those black and white images bringing them back to life? This repository talks about that! 

This repository is dedicated for implmentation of a software solution that would help facilitate users to upload a black-white images and get a coloured image 

# Project Details
The project is divided into three parts that are:
1. Building the model with GANs.
2. Building a front-end on which we can display the results.
3. Building a back-end on which we can mount our model.

# Technology
1. Python
2. Flask
3. GAN
4. React
5. Typescript
...

# Run
1. Create a copy of the project.
2. Open command prompt and change you current path to folder where you can find `app.py` file.
3. Download the [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VhotvmQcCcPtLSGMyLe5LoDXkMC0F8Ql) and save it into the project folder.
4. Use command below to install required dependencies `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start the back-end by command given `python app.py`
6. Start the front-end `npm install && npm start`
7. You can now upload image and check the generated result.
